        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>It is used to give your website, or content, structure; like the framing of a house.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage and is not always visible to the end user.</li>
          <li>There are several different metadata tags that can be used within the head element such as Title to denote the title of the webpage or Link which can link an external resource to your webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Content for visible HTML elements are contained between and opening tag and a closing tag. Each tag is represented by angle brackets and the tag name listed inside them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Used to define how webpage content is presented to the end user.</li>
          <li>Three different style methods; Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS; used to style one specific element directly. Quick but not preferable for large changes.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS; used to style webpage in the head section of HTML. Changes made to this rule will apply to all tagged elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS: Most common method and preferred because you can store all rules in an external file which you can then link to your website.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain CSS property to be worked with and the value to apply to that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>* Declaration indicates you want ALL the elements on that webpage to contain the following properties.</li>
